## What is acoustic monitoring?

Acoustic monitoring uses small, autonomous sound recorders to capture the soundscapes of natural environments. These devices record birds, bats, amphibians, insects, mammals, and environmental sounds — providing a rich source of biodiversity data.

Unlike visual systems such as AMI, acoustic monitoring focuses on **species that are easier to hear than see**, and it makes it possible to sample continuously over long periods with very little field effort.

Acoustics is a core monitoring approach in WildSense, supporting bird surveys, bat activity assessments, soundscape ecology, and long-term environmental change research.

## Devices we use

Acoustic monitoring within WildSense makes use of several widely used, low-cost or professional-grade devices, including:

- **AudioMoth** – ultra-low-cost, open-source autonomous recorder  
- **Song Meter recorders (Wildlife Acoustics)** – high-quality field units for bird and bat surveys  
- **Bat detectors** – for ultrasonic and high-frequency bat monitoring  
- **Custom-built recorders** – specialised units used in research projects and long-term observatories  

Each of these recorders supports different sampling strategies and environments, making acoustic monitoring extremely flexible.

## Why acoustic monitoring matters

Acoustic methods are essential for tracking biodiversity because:

- Many species, especially **birds, bats, and amphibians**, are best detected by sound.
- Acoustic recorders can operate **continuously**, capturing data at all hours.
- They provide **non-intrusive**, standardised sampling across long periods.
- Devices are **portable and inexpensive**, enabling broad-scale deployments.
- Recordings create a **permanent archive**, allowing for re-analysis as models improve.

Acoustic monitoring helps reveal:

- Bird community composition  
- Bat activity levels  
- Amphibian breeding behaviour  
- Soundscape health  
- Habitat quality and change over time  

---

## Where we use acoustic monitoring

Acoustic surveys are active or planned across multiple WildSense projects, including:

- Woodland and farmland bird monitoring  
- Bat activity assessments  
- Tropical forest soundscape studies  
- Biodiversity surveys in protected areas  
- Long-term observatories and restoration projects  

As the platform grows, acoustics will remain a key technique for capturing species that AMI or LepiSense cannot detect.

## How the system works

### **Recording**
Autonomous devices (e.g., AudioMoth, Song Meter, bat detectors) are deployed in the field and programmed to:

- record continuously or at scheduled intervals  
- capture dawn choruses, nocturnal activity, or specific target taxa  
- operate for weeks or months with minimal maintenance  

### **Data processing**
Recordings are processed through AI/ML workflows, including:

- bird classifiers  
- bat call recognisers  
- amphibian call detectors  
- acoustic indices and soundscape metrics  

These models help identify species, quantify activity, and produce ecological summaries.

### **Outputs**
The processed data supports:

- species-level detections  
- occupancy modelling  
- biodiversity indicators  
- restoration monitoring  
- long-term community trend analysis  

### **Integration within WildSense**

Acoustic monitoring joins AMI, LepiSense, and other system streams to create a **multi-modal biodiversity picture**, combining:

- images  
- sounds  
- remote sensing  
- environmental context  

Together, they create a more complete assessment of ecosystem health.
