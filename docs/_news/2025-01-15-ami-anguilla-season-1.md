We have deployed our first AMI (Automated Monitoring of Insects) units in Anguilla in collaboration with local
partners. The systems are monitoring nocturnal insects across a range of coastal and inland habitats.

This deployment will help us understand migratory insect movements and build the evidence base needed to support
future conservation decisions on the island.
