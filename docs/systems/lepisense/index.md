## What is LepiSense?

LepiSense is a lightweight, miniaturised version of the AMI system, designed to make automated imaging of moths and butterflies more accessible, scalable, and easier to deploy.  
Where AMI is built for high-volume, long-term global monitoring, LepiSense focuses on **lower-cost, portable deployments** that researchers and partners can use in more experimental or resource-limited settings.

The system builds on everything learned from AMI, while prioritising simplicity, rapid testing, and smaller-scale data collection.

## Why LepiSense matters

Monitoring Lepidoptera is crucial for understanding environmental change, yet traditional surveys are often:

- labour intensive  
- dependent on specialist expertise  
- inconsistent across sites or observers  

LepiSense offers a way to collect **standardised, automated imagery** without needing the full AMI infrastructure.

It is especially useful for:

- **Pilot and feasibility studies**  
- **Student or short-term research projects**  
- **Low-budget monitoring scenarios**  
- **Complementing larger AMI deployments** with additional local sampling  
- **Testing models, workflows, and new AI classifiers** before scaling up  

As development continues, LepiSense will support integration with existing image classification pipelines and contribute to long-term biodiversity indicators.

## Where LepiSense is being used

LepiSense is currently in an **early testing phase**, with pilot deployments planned or underway across UKCEH projects.  
These include:

- small-scale test plots  
- early feasibility deployments  
- integration testing alongside AMI traps  
- climate-controlled chamber testing for calibration  

As the system matures, widespread field deployments will follow.

## How the system works

Although still evolving, LepiSense follows the same core principles as AMI:

### **Lightweight hardware**
- Compact imaging unit  
- Low-power LEDs for attraction  
- Small-form sensor housing  
- Basic onboard computer for scheduling and logging  
- Designed for portability and rapid field setup  

### **Data collection**
- Captures images of moths and other nocturnal insects  
- Flexible sampling schedules  
- Suited to short-term deployments and rapid prototyping  
- Lower storage requirements than AMI  

### **Analysis (current & future)**
- Compatible with AMI-derived classification workflows  
- Produces small, clean test datasets for model development  
- Future versions may include:
  - on-device inference  
  - improved synchronisation with AMI datasets  
  - integration with cloud dashboards  

### **Development goals**
LepiSense aims to be:

- **Affordable**  
- **Robust**  
- **Easy to transport and deploy**  
- **Interoperable** with AMI data pipelines  
- **Suitable for mass distribution** in future student, partner, and citizen-science programmes
