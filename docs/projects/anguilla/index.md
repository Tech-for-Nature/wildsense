## Overview

Evidence is mounting of declines in wildlife across the globe. We critically lack data on ‘the little things that run the world’ - insects. We will use innovative technologies to monitor insects with automated sensors and computer vision. Complementary citizen science projects will collect wildlife observations to train artificial intelligence (AI) models. With Anguilla Natural Trust we will deploy four automated camera systems across Anguilla and measure outcomes from restoration projects targeted at globally important bird and reptile species.

We’re combining:

- **Imaging systems (AMI)** to quantify nocturnal insect diversity and activity.
- **Cloud processing pipelines** to move from raw data → classified detections → ecological indicators.
- **Community engagement** to highlight the importance of insects as environmental indicators.

## Aims
- Test how well AMI and acoustic systems operate in a small, exposed island environment.
- Develop practical workflows for deployment, data retrieval, and analysis with local partners.
- Co-design biodiversity monitoring and indicators that are meaningful for Anguilla’s conservation priorities.
