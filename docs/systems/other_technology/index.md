## What are these monitoring technologies?

This section covers **supporting monitoring methods** that complement the main WildSense systems (AMI, LepiSense, Acoustics, Ultrasonic).

These technologies help capture aspects of biodiversity and environmental change that cannot be observed through images or sound alone — including soil biodiversity, pollinator activity, and microclimate conditions.

## Soil monitoring

Soil-based approaches help quantify below-ground biodiversity and ecological processes.

These include:

### **eDNA sampling**
Used to detect:
- soil invertebrates  
- microbial communities  
- fungi  
- plant DNA  

### **Soil health indicators**
Tracking:
- organic matter  
- moisture  
- nutrient availability  
- physical structure  

### **Microbial community profiling**
Using molecular methods to understand:
- microbial diversity  
- functional groups  
- ecological processes  

These datasets help interpret patterns seen in AMI and acoustic surveys.

## Pollinator monitoring technologies

WildSense explores technologies for monitoring pollinators, including early-stage automated systems such as camera-based insect counters (e.g. “InsectDetect / InsectDetects”, name pending standardisation).

These tools aim to:

- record flower visitation  
- detect and classify pollinators using machine learning  
- capture behaviour and activity patterns  
- support crop pollination and ecosystem function studies  

These are **active areas of development**, with future expansion expected.

## Environmental sensing

Environmental sensors provide the context needed to interpret species-level signals.

Typical sensors include:

- temperature loggers  
- humidity sensors  
- light intensity meters  
- rainfall and moisture sensors  
- microclimate monitoring stations  

These measurements help link species observations to environmental conditions.

## How these technologies support WildSense

These monitoring methods are **supporting layers**, not standalone systems. They:

- complement image- and sound-based monitoring  
- provide crucial context for modelling biodiversity  
- connect above-ground and below-ground processes  
- enhance long-term ecosystem datasets  

As WildSense grows, this section will include additional experimental technologies and pilot sensors.
