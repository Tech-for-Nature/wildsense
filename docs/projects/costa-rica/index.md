## Overview

This project deploys automated imaging systems in Costa Rican forests to quantify nocturnal insect
and pollinator communities along environmental gradients.

## Aims

- Test how imaging systems perform in humid, high-diversity tropical environments.
- Develop robust workflows for data capture, upload, and cloud-based classification.
- Link insect community metrics to habitat type, elevation, and land-use change.

## What we’re doing

- Installing imaging systems at multiple forest and edge sites.
- Running image classification models and targeted manual verification.
- Comparing community metrics between sites and over time.

The methods and pipelines developed here will inform other tropical deployments across the
WildSense portfolio.
