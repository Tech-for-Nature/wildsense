## Overview

Anguilla sits on a major migratory route for insects, birds, and other taxa crossing the Atlantic.
This project explores how automated monitoring systems can capture those movements in a consistent,
scalable way.

We’re combining:

- **Imaging systems (AMI)** to quantify nocturnal insect diversity and abundance.
- **Acoustic recorders** to track vocal species and ambient soundscapes over time.
- **Cloud processing pipelines** to move from raw data → classified detections → ecological indicators.

## Aims

- Test how well AMI and acoustic systems operate in a small, exposed island environment.
- Develop practical workflows for deployment, data retrieval, and analysis with local partners.
- Co-design biodiversity indicators that are meaningful for Anguilla’s conservation priorities.

## What we’re doing

- Deploying imaging and acoustic devices at key coastal and inland sites.
- Running automated classification models and manual verification to understand accuracy.
- Working with government and NGO partners to integrate findings into existing monitoring efforts.

## Why Anguilla?

Anguilla provides a “microcosm” for broader Atlantic migratory systems:

- It is small enough to trial end-to-end monitoring workflows.
- It sits on globally important migratory pathways.
- It has active local partners interested in testing new technologies.

The lessons we learn here will feed directly into other WildSense projects, including larger-scale
deployments in the Americas and beyond.
